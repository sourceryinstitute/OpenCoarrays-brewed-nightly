# OpenCoarrays-brewed-nightly
🌔Nightly ☕️brews of OpenCoarrays
A simple Travis-CI.com script to be run nightly to catch when changes to [OpenCoarrays] or
Mac [Homebrew] break building and packaging [OpenCoarrays] with [Homebrew].

This more or less runs the [Homebrew] CI process, including bottle building, on [OpenCoarrays]'
`master` branch.
